Study C&Cpp by myself. There are some exercises during the studying, most of which are from CS1501 in sjtu.

Exercise 1 is the program that print the last position of a character in a string.

Exercise 2 is the program that practise writing a function to realize the power of an integer. 

Exercise 3 is the program that realign a string with "Z" order.

Exercise 4 is the program that determine the time when the first ball drops and the time of the last in "crash particles problem".
